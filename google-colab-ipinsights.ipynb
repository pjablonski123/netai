[Epilogue](#Epilogue)\n","\n","## Introduction\n","-------\n","\n","The Amazon SageMaker IP Insights algorithm uses statistical modeling and neural networks to capture associations between online resources (such as account IDs or hostnames) and IPv4 addresses. Under the hood, it learns vector representations for online resources and IP addresses. This essentially means that if the vector representing an IP address and an online resource are close together, then it is likey for that IP address to access that online resource, even if it has never accessed it before.\n","\n","In this notebook, we use the Amazon SageMaker IP Insights algorithm to train a model on synthetic data. We then use this model to perform inference on the data and show how to discover anomalies. After running this notebook, you should be able to:\n","\n","- obtain, transform, and store data for use in Amazon SageMaker,\n","- create an AWS SageMaker training job to produce an IP Insights model,\n","- use the model to perform inference with an Amazon SageMaker endpoint.\n","\n","If you would like to know more, please check out the [SageMaker IP Inisghts Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ip-insights.html). \n","\n","## Setup\n","------\n","*This notebook was created and tested on a ml.m4.xlarge notebook instance.*\n","\n","Our first step is to setup our AWS credentials so that AWS SageMaker can store and access training data and model artifacts.\n","\n","### Select Amazon S3 Bucket\n","We first need to specify the locations where we will store our training data and trained model artifacts. ***This is the only cell of this notebook that you will need to edit.*** In particular, we need the following data:\n","\n","- `bucket` - An S3 bucket accessible by this account.\n","- `prefix` - The location in the bucket where this notebook's input and output data will be stored.

And luckily for us, it logs all requests processed by the server - by default. If a web page requires HTTP authentication, the Apache Web Server will log the IP address and authenticated user name for each requested resource. \n","\n","The [access logs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/logs.html) are typically on the server under the file `/var/log/httpd/access_log`. From the example log output below, we see which IP addresses each user has connected with:\n","\n","```\n","192.168.1.100 - user1 [15/Oct/2018:18:58:32 +0000] \"GET /login_success?userId=1 HTTP/1.1\" 200 476 \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36\"\n","192.168.1.102 - user2 [15/Oct/2018:18:58:35 +0000] \"GET /login_success?userId=2 HTTP/1.1\" 200 - \"-\" \"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/69.0.3497.100 Safari/537.36\"\n","...\n","```\n","\n","If we want to train an algorithm to detect suspicious activity, this dataset is ideal for SageMaker IP Insights.\n","\n","First, we determine the resource we want to be analyzing (such as a login page or access to a protected file). Then, we construct a dataset containing the history of all past user interactions with the resource. We extract out each 'access event' from the log and store the corresponding user name and IP address in a headerless CSV file with two columns. The first column will contain the user identifier string, and the second will contain the IPv4 address in decimal-dot notation. \n","\n","```\n","user1, 192.168.1.100\n","user2, 193.168.1.102\n","...\n","```\n","\n","As a side note, the dataset should include all access events.

See [Recommended Instance Types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/ip-insights.html#ip-insights-instances) for more details. \n","\n","### Training Job Configuration\n","- **train_instance_type**: the instance type to train on. We recommend `p3.2xlarge` for single GPU, `p3.8xlarge` for multi-GPU, and `m5.2xlarge` if using distributed training with CPU;\n","- **train_instance_count**: the number of worker nodes in the training cluster.\n","\n","We need to also configure SageMaker IP Insights-specific hypeparameters:\n","\n","### Model Hyperparameters\n","- **num_entity_vectors**: the total number of embeddings to train. We use an internal hashing mechanism to map the entity ID strings to an embedding index; therefore, using an embedding size larger than the total number of possible values helps reduce the number of hash collisions. We recommend this value to be 2x the total number of unique entites (i.e. user names) in your dataset;\n","- **vector_dim**: the size of the entity and IP embedding vectors. The larger the value, the more information can be encoded using these representations but using too large vector representations may cause the model to overfit, especially for small training data sets;\n","- **num_ip_encoder_layers**: the number of layers in the IP encoder network. The larger the number of layers, the higher the model capacity to capture patterns among IP addresses. However, large number of layers increases the chance of overfitting. `num_ip_encoder_layers=1` is a good value to start experimenting with;\n","- **random_negative_sampling_rate**: the number of randomly generated negative samples to produce per 1 positive sample; `random_negative_sampling_rate=1` is a good value to start experimenting with;\n","    - Random negative samples are produced by drawing each octet from a uniform distributed of [0, 255];\n","- **shuffled_negative_sampling_rate**: the number of shuffled negative samples to produce per 1 positive sample; `shuffled_negative_sampling_rate=1` is a good value to start experimenting with;\n","    - Shuffled negative samples are produced by shuffling the accounts within a batch;\n","\n","### Training Hyperparameters\n","- **epochs**: the number of epochs to train. Increase this value if you continue to see the accuracy and cross entropy improving over the last few epochs;\n","- **mini_batch_size**: how many examples in each mini_batch. A smaller number improves convergence with stochastic gradient descent. But a larger number is necessary if using shuffled_negative_sampling to avoid sampling a wrong account for a negative sample;\n","- **learning_rate**: the learning rate for the Adam optimizer (try ranges in [0.001, 0.1]). Too large learning rate may cause the model to diverge since the training would be likely to overshoot minima. On the other hand, too small learning rate slows down the convergence;\n","- **weight_decay**: L2 regularization coefficient.

All SageMaker algorithms come with support for two additional services that make optimizing and using the algorithm that much easier: Automatic Model Tuning and Batch Transform service. \n","\n","\n","### Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning\n","The results above were based on using the default hyperparameters of the SageMaker IP Insights algorithm. If we wanted to improve the model's performance even more, we can use [Amazon SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html) to automate the process of finding the hyperparameters. \n","\n","#### Validation Dataset\n","Previously, we separated our dataset into a training and test set to validate the performance of a single IP Insights model. However, when we do model tuning, we train many IP Insights models in parallel. If we were to use the same test dataset to select the best model, we bias our model selection such that we don't know if we selected the best model in general, or just the best model for that particular dateaset. \n","\n","Therefore, we need to separate our test set into a validation dataset and a test dataset. The validation dataset is used for model selection. Then once we pick the model with the best performance, we evaluate it the winner on a test set just as before. \n","\n","#### Validation Metrics\n","For SageMaker Automatic Model Tuning to work, we need an objective metric which determines the performance of the model we want to optimize. Because SageMaker IP Insights is an usupervised algorithm, we do not have a clearly defined metric for performance (such as percentage of fraudulent events discovered). \n","\n","We allow the user to provide a validation set of sample data (same format as training data bove) through the `validation` channel. We then fix the negative sampling strategy to use `random_negative_sampling_rate=1` and `shuffled_negative_sampling_rate=0` and generate a validation dataset by assigning corresponding labels to the real and simulated data. We then calculate the model's `descriminator_auc` metric. We do this by taking the model's predicted labels and the 'true' simulated labels and compute the Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) on the model's performance.\n","\n","We set up the `HyperParameterTuner` to maximize the `discriminator_auc` on the validation dataset. We also need to set the search space for the hyperparameters.
